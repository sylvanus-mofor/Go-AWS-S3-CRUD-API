#Troubleshooting#
##Unable to Upload Files##

Ensure that the file path is correct and that the file exists.
Check the S3 bucket policy to ensure that the necessary permissions for uploading files are granted.

##File Not Found##

Ensure the correct key (filename) is used for deleting or fetching files.
List the files using the /list endpoint to verify their existence.

##AWS Credentials Issue##

Verify that the AWS CLI is configured properly and that the credentials have the necessary permissions for S3 operations.

##Server Errors##

Check the console logs for error messages.
Ensure that the server has access to the internet if you are using AWS services.
Maintenance
Regularly check the AWS S3 bucket for unused files and delete them if necessary.
Monitor application logs for errors or unexpected behavior.
